## 1. BASICS
  #### Print
  Prints a string into the console.
  ``` Python
  print("Hello World")
  ```
  
  #### Input
  Prints a string into the console, and asks the user for a string input.
  ``` Python
  input("What's your name? ")
  ```
  
  #### Comments
  Adding a # symbol in font of text lets you make comments on a line of code. The computer will ignore your comments.
  ``` Python
  #This is a comment
  print("This is code")
  ```
  
  #### Variables
  A variable give a name to a piece of data. Like a box with a label, it tells you what's inside the box.
  ``` Python
  my_name = "Angela"
  my_age = 12
  ```
  
  #### The += Operator
  This is a convient way of saying: "take the previous value and add to it."
  ``` Python
  my_age = 12
  my_age += 4
  # my_age is now 16
  ```

## 2. DATA TYPES
  #### Integers
  Integers are whole numbers.
  ``` Python
  my_number = 354
  ```
  
  #### Floating Point Numbers
  Floats are numbers with decimal places. When you do a calculation that results in a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be a floating point number.
  ``` Python
  my_float = 3.14159
  ```
  
  #### Strings
  A string is just a string of characters. It should be surrounded by double quotes.
  ``` Python
  my_string = "Hello"
  ```
  
  #### String Concatenation
  You can add strings to string to create a new string. This is called concatenation.It results in a new string.
  ``` Python
  "Hello" + "Angela"
  # becomes "HelloAngela"
  ```
      
  #### Escaping a String
  Because the double quote is special, it denotes a string, if you want to use it in a string, you need to escape it with a "\"
  ``` Python
  speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
  print(speech)
  # prints: She said: "Hi"
  ```
   
  #### F-Strings
  You can insert a variable into a string using f-strings. The syntax is simple, just insert the variable in-between a set of curly braces {}.
  ``` Python
  days = 365
  print(f"There are {days} in a year")
  ```
      
  #### Converting Data Types
  You can convert a variable from one data type to another.\
  Converting to float:\
  `float()`\
  Converting to int:\
  `int()`\
  Converting to string:\
  `str()`
  
  ``` Python
  n = 354
  new_n = float(n)
  print(new_n)      # result 354.0
  ```
      
  #### Checking Data Types
  You can use the `type()` function to check what is the data type of a particular variable.
  ``` Python
  n = 3.14159
  type(n)      #result float
  ```

## 3. MATHS
  #### Arithmetic Operators
  You can do mathematical calculations with Python as long as you know the right operators.
  ``` Python
  3+2   #Add
  4-1   #Subtract
  2*3   #Multiply
  5/2   #Divide
  5**2  #Exponent
  ```
      
  #### The += Operator
  This is a convenient way to modify a variable. It takes the existing value in a variable and adds to it. You can also use any of the other mathematical operators e.g. -= or *=
  ``` Python
  my_number = 6
  my_number += 2
  my_number *= 2
  my_number -= 1
  my_number /= 3
  ```
  
  #### The Modulo (%) Operator
  Often you'll want to know what is the remainder after a division. e.g. 4 รท 2 = 2 with no remainder, but 5 รท 2 = 2 with 1 remainder. The modulo does not give you the result of the division, just the remainder. It can be really helpful in certain situations, e.g. figuring out if a number is odd or even.
  ``` Python
  5 % 2
  # result is 1
  ```

## 4. ERRORS
  #### Syntax Error
  Syntax errors happen when your code does not make any sense to the computer. This can happen because you've misspelt something or there's too many brackets or
a missing comma.
  ``` Python
  print(12 + 4))
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      print(12 + 4))
                   ^
  SyntaxError: unmatched ')'
  ```
  
  #### Name Error
  This happens when there is a variable with a name that the computer  does not recognise. It's usually because you've misspelt the name of a variable you created earlier.\
  ***Note***: variable names are case sensitive!
  ``` Python
  my_number = 4
  my_Number + 2
  Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1,
  NameError: name 'my_Number' is not defined
  ```
  
  #### Zero Division Error
  This happens when you try to divide by zero. This is something that is mathematically impossible so Python will also complain.
  ``` Python
  5 % 0
  Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1,
  ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
  ```

## 5. FUNCTIONS  
  #### Creating Functions
  This is the basic syntax for a function in Python. It allows you to give a set of instructions a name, so you can trigger it multiple times without having to re-write or copy-paste it. The contents of the function must be indented to signal that it's inside.
  ``` Python
  def my_function():
      print("Hello")
      name = input("Your name:")
      print("Hello")
  ```
  
  #### Calling Functions
  You activate the function by calling it. This is simply done by writing the name of the function followed by a set of round brackets. This allows you to determine
when to trigger the function and how many times.
  ``` Python
  my_function()
  my_function()
  # The function my_function will run twice.
  ```
  
  #### Functions with Inputs
  In addition to simple functions, you can give the function an input, this way, each time the function can do something different depending on the input. It makes your function more useful and re-usable.
  ``` Python
  def add(n1, n2):
      print(n1 + n2)
  
  add(2, 3)
  ```
  
  #### Functions with Outputs
  In addition to inputs, a function can also have an output. The output value is proceeded by the keyword `return`. This allows you to store the result from a
function.
  ``` Python
  def add(n1, n2):
      return n1 + n2
  
  result = add(2, 3)
  ```
  
  #### Variable Scope
  Variables created inside a function are destroyed once the function has executed. The location (line of code) that you use a variable will determine its value. Here n is 2 but inside my_function() n is 3. So printing n inside and outside the function will determine its value.
  ``` Python
  n = 2
  def my_function():
      n = 3
      print(n)
  
  print(n)        # Prints 2
  my_function()   # Prints 3
  ```
  
  #### Keyword Arguments
  When calling a function, you can provide a keyword argument or simply just the value.\
  Using a keyword argument means that you don't have to follow any order when providing the inputs.
  ``` Python
  def divide(n1, n2):
      result = n1 / n2
  
  # Option 1:
  divide(10, 5)

  # Option 2:
  divide(n2=5, n1=10)
  ```

## 6. CONDITIONALS
  #### If
  This is the basic syntax to test if a condition is true. If so, the indented code will be executed, if not it will be skipped.
  ``` Python
  n = 5
  if n > 2:
      print("Larger than 2")
  ```

  #### Else
  This is a way to specify some code that will be executed if a condition is false.
  ``` Python
  age = 18
  if age > 16:
      print("Can drive")
  else:
      print("Don't drive")
  ```

  #### Elif
  In addition to the initial If statement condition, you can add extra conditions to test if the first condition is false.\
  Once an elif condition is true, the rest of the elif conditions are no longer checked and are skipped.
  ``` Python
  weather = "sunny"
  if weather == "rain":
      print("bring umbrella")
  elif weather == "sunny":
      print("bring sunglasses")
  elif weather == "snow":
      print("bring gloves")
  else:
      print("may be good for outdoor activities")
  ```

  #### and
  This expects both conditions either side of the `and` to be true.
  ``` Python
  s = 58
  if s > 50 and s < 60:
      print("Your grade is C")
  ```

  #### or
  This expects either of the conditions either side of the `or` to be true. Basically, both conditions cannot be false.
  ``` Python
  age = 12
  if age < 16 or age > 200:
      print("Can't drive")
  ```

  #### not
  This will flip the original result of the condition. e.g. if it was true then it's now false.
  ``` Python
  if not 3 > 1:
      print("something")    # Will not be printed.
  ```

  #### Input
  Prints a string into the console, and asks the user for a string input.
  ``` Python
  input("What's your name? ")
  ```
