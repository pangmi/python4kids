#### Integers
  Integers are whole numbers.
  ``` Python
  my_number = 354
  ```
  
#### Floating Point Numbers
  Floats are numbers with decimal places. When you do a calculation that results in a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be a floating point number.
  ``` Python
  my_float = 3.14159
  ```
  
#### Strings
  A string is just a string of characters. It should be surrounded by double quotes or single quotes.
  ``` Python
  my_string = "Hello"
  my_string = 'Hello world'
  ```
  
#### Booleans
  Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`.
  ``` Python
  my_bool = True
  ```

#### Converting Data Types
  You can convert a variable from one data type to another.\
  Converting to float:\
  `float()`\
  Converting to int:\
  `int()`\
  Converting to string:\
  `str()`
  
  ``` Python
  n = 354
  new_n = float(n)
  print(new_n)      # result 354.0
  ```
      
#### Checking Data Types
  You can use the `type()` function to check what is the data type of a particular variable.
  ``` Python
  n = 3.14159
  type(n)      #result float
  ```
