## BASICS
#### Print
Prints a string into the console.
``` Python
print("Hello World")
```
  
#### Input
Displays a prompting string on the console and asks the user for a string input.
``` Python
input("What's your name? ")
```
  
#### Comments
Adding a # symbol in font of text lets you make comments on a line of code. The computer will ignore your comments.
``` Python
# This is a comment
print("This is code")
```
  
#### Variables
A variable give a name to a piece of data. Like a box with a label, it tells you what's inside the box.
``` Python
my_name = "Angela"
my_age = 12
```
